        Boom! Boom! Boom! That’s all we hear outside. Rex and I hide in our crate cuddling each other nervously about what is going to happen. I haven't seen mom since the booms started. I hope she is okay. The last time I heard noises like this I was at a– what mom called a– Baseball Park. We were watching a movie when I saw flashing lights in the sky with loud sounds. I was so scared. My dad held me as I freaked out and tried to run. I was fine every now and then, but they seem to get closer and louder. Eventually, they stopped and we left and everything was fine. I am sure everything will be fine and mom will be back soon.
