        The first summer day has arrived! I have spent the first few hours cuddling with mom waiting for her to wake up. I don’t know why she sleeps so late after sunrise. Oh, wait, here she goes finally waking up. She’s blinking her eyes and stretching this is my time to shine. I jump onto the bed and lunge toward her face to give her kisses.
        She pushes me off her face, but she is finally getting up. All I can think about is all the adventures we are going to do today. It's breakfast time! Come on mom, the food is in this closet did you forget. Right here! This door! Yes! Munch. Munch. Munch.
        Today, mom didn't put on those black pants and black shirts with those shoes that smell like food today, instead, she put on that white hat and some shorts, and a throw-over shirt. I was wondering where she was going. She even dressed me in my star wars themed bandana and my brother in the blue checkered bandana. She grabbed our leashes and the bags she uses to pick up our poop. I got excited. I was going with her today! Hmmm to wear though?
        I jumped in the car. My mom buckled me in. I laid down and waited until it was time to get out. I jumped out of the car and we were at a park! I heard about these! My big brother told me about how fun it is to fetch the ball and chase other dogs! I am so nervous though, there are a lot of big dogs and such a big field. I think I will stick with mom this time around.
